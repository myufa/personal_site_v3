                I am a software engineer and recent grad from The University of Michigan(Go Blue!). 
                I love building fun side projects that my friends can make use of. <br /><br />

                Startups are my thing. 
                Iâ€™ve worked as an engineer with a small founding team @ Pearl and Dexter, 
                have helped procure funding for startups @ UpRound Venture Capital, 
                and have started my own @ Blind Date. <br /><br />

                I also make music (:
            </p>
        </div>
    )
